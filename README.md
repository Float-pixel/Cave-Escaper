# Cave-Escaper
a free gameboy game made for Ludwig's Foddian Game Jam
Thanks for checking out my game!

This is a real, working gameboy game. You can throw this onto a flash cart and it will run on actual gameboy hardware.

Alternatively, just run it in an emulator. I recommend BGB or Gambatte.


BRIEF EXPLANATION OF GAMEPLAY:

The games 16 levels are arranged in a 4x4 grid. You start on the first floor in the bottom left corner and snake your way through the grid to reach the exit on the top left corner of the grid. But be careful! You can fall between the floors if you miss a jump! 

I hope you enjoy!




If you want to 'compile' the game yourself, I have included the precise version of GB Studio I used, or you can download it yourself from: https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta5

Open "gb-studio.exe", and then open "Cave Escaper.gbsproj" within GB Studio. At the top right corner there will be a "play" button. This can be used to test compile the game (clicking the spinning circle that replaces the play button will let you see where it is in the compiling process).

To export a new ROM or Web Build, click the "Export As" button to the left of that play button.

I have included the ROM of my game and a free to use gameboy emulator called BGB in the GAME folder.
You can run "bgb.exe" and then just drag "Cave Escaper.gb" into the window it creates to start playing!

Arrow Keys are the D-PAD, Z and X act as A and B, Enter and Shift as Start and Select. If you need to bind controls in BGB, you can right click the window to see options.
